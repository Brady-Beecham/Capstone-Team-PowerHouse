## Capabilities

Here explain in more detail (though not as much as will be given in the datasheet) what the version of this project in this repo is capable of doing.


## Salient Outcomes

Projects often have some outcomes that are more interesting than others. Here, highlight those things that you found interesting!


## Project Demonstration & Images

Give a link to a video of the project being demonstrated. The video should be hosted on the capstone youtube.

## About Us

### Team

Abdulrahman Alrudayan is a senior Electrical Engineering major at Tennessee Technological University.  His interests include power systems and digital design.  The main focus for Abdulrahman is designing the main power system that will distribute power to the entire system through the use of buck converters, step down transformers, etc.

Khalifah Altamimi is a senior Electrical Engineering major at Tennessee Technological University.  His interests include power systems, robotics, and digital design.  The main focus for Khalifah is designing the backup power system that will provide power to allow the system to continue working when a power outage has occurred on campus.  When the system is not being used, it will be charging and stay charged until backup power is needed for the system.

Brady Beecham is a senior Computer Engineering major at Tennessee Technological University.  His interests

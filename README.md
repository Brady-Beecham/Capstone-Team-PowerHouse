# {Parking Lot Monitoring System: Ground Based Solution}

## Executive Summary

This project is a continuation project from the 2022-23 academic year at Tennessee Technological University to monitor parking lots in a manner that allows students, faculty, staff, and campus visitors to find parking lots with availability in a timely manner. The previous team used cameras to monitor incoming and outgoing traffic in parking lots.  This solution will not work for many of the parking lots that do not have the infrastructure nearby to support cameras.  By using inductive loops to monitor designated entrances/exits of parking lots, more parking lots across campus can be monitored and students, faculty, etc. can find parking availability without having to search an entire parking lot in hopes of finding an open parking spot.

## Capabilities

Though this project is a continuation project, it deviates away from using cameras and instead uses a ground-based solution.  Each capability of the project is mentioned:

1. This project will detect vehicles and motorcycles entering/exiting parking lots that have designated entrances/exits.
2. This project will only detect vehicles and motorcycles that enter/exit a parking lot at a speed less than 20 mph.
3. This project will use LoRaWAN to transmit data from a designated entrance/exit of a parking lot to the Capstone Lab in Brown Hall for data interpretation and storage into the server.
4. For testing this project in the Engineering Quad Parking Lot (between the engineering buildings on the campus of Tennessee Tech University), one entrance/exit will use solar power, with a backup battery, to power the inductive loops and the transmitter for the data.  By using solar power, parking lots that are not located near buildings with wall outlets can generate power and function across the campus of Tennessee Tech.

## Salient Outcomes

1. This project will continue the work of creating an effective Parking Lot Monitoring System.

   a. As of September 2023, the Parking Lot Monitoring System is in the second year of the overall project.  This team has inherited a previous system that used cameras to do complete both static tracking (monitor parked cars) and dynamic tracking (cars entering and exiting lots) to efficiently monitor parking lots.  This method is a very efficient way to monitor parking lots; however, parking lots that are located away from campus buildings or do not have the infrastructure to support camera placement in the lots do not benefit from this method.  By using a ground-based solution to monitor parking lots with designated entrances/exits, more parking lots can be monitored across the campus of Tennessee Tech.

2. This project will implement the use of solar panels to efficiently power the system.

   a. Some parking lots across the campus of Tennessee Tech are not located near campus buildings.  To allow the system to work in these lots, solar panels will be used to power the system at these lots to efficiently monitor these lots so students, faculty, etc. know if there is parking availability at these specific lots.

3. This project will use LoRaWAN to transmit and receive data from the inductive loops.

   a. To avoid having issues with using WiFi to transmit and receive data, LoRaWAN is used as it uses a higher frequency than WiFi and also has better penetration of buildings and longer range versus using WiFi.

### Stakeholders

The primary customer for this project is the Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division in Dahlgren, VA, that is under the command of the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA). 

One major stakeholder that will be affected by the project are commuter students.  Commuter students will use this system heavily as they must find parking in a timely manner in specific parking lots in order to be on time for class or extracurricular events on campus.

Another stakeholder that will be affected by the project are campus visitors.  For visitors that have come to Tennessee Tech University numerous times or for first time visitors, it will be extremely useful in locating parking lots that have availability to allow them more time to complete business they have on campus and not have to spend a significant amount of time finding places to park on campus.

### Recognitions

Since this project is a continuation from the 2022-23 academic year, this team wants to recognize the previous Parking Lot Monitoring System team and their members: Kester Nucum, Aaron Wilhite, Gabriel Laboy, Genevieve Schreiber, and Reggie Garza.  This team consisted of three computer engineering students and two electrical engineering students.  With their knowledge and collaboration with the CSC team, they were successful in creating a server, sign, and cameras to detect and count the number of vehicles in a specified parking lot.  Due to their work, this team of three electrical engineering students and two computer engineering students was able to create a ground-based solution to assist the current camera system in detecting vehicles entering and leaving a parking lot and display an accurate number of available parking spots within a specific parking lot.

Another group to recognize for this project is the NAVSEA representatives from Dahlgren, VA: Robert Sexton and Kristen Voyles.  By having their knowledge and expertise of both electrical/computer engineering and the engineering design process, the team was able to learn how to successfully work together as a team while using the knowledge and skills each team member has obtained over the course of their undergraduate education and apply it to a real-world engineering problem.

For this project, the supervisor, Jesse Roberts, held an important role in this project.  Since this is a continuation project, the team relied heavily on Mr. Roberts' input as to what direction the project needed to go and also know the expected output of the project.  With Mr. Roberts' knowledge, the team was successful in finding faults in the previous team's work and able to find a solution in aiding the use of cameras across parking lots.

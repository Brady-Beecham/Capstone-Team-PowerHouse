# Ground-Based Sensor Subsystem


# Constraints
| No. | Constraints | Origin |
| --- | ----------- | ------ |
| 1.  | Subsystem shall detect cars/pickup trucks (vehicles) and motorcycles that are entering a parking lot at a maximum speed of 20 mph and leaving a parking lot at a maximum speed of 20 mph. | System Requirements |
| 2.  | Vehicle detector shall cover a range of at least 50 &mu;H to 1000 &mu;H at a frequency at 50 kHz | NEMA Detector Standard 6.5.2.11 Loop/Lead in Electrical Properties    |
| 3.  | Vehicle detector shall be compliant with the FCC frequency range for Intentional Radiators and verifying the detector is within permissible part 15 frequencies.  | FCC Standard Title 47, Chapter I, Subchapter A, Section 15.202     |
| 4.  | Each entrance/exit of a parking lot shall have a total of two inductive loops for determining whether a car/pickup truck is entering a parking lot or leaving a parking lot. | System Requirements |
| 5.  | All components of the subsystem, with the exception of the inductive loops and lead-in wire to the induction loops, shall be placed in an area that does not affect pedestrian traffic along the road or nearby sidewalks.  | System Requirements |
| 6.  | All turns in the inductive loop shall be a 45° turn (or 135° as noted in the schematic drawing) to avoid damaging the wire(s) that create the inductive loop that comes from using 90° turns.  | System Requirements |
| 7.  | Any wire that is used as part of the loop and is connected to the vehicle detector shall be protected using a heavy-duty cable protector that is capable of protecting the wires under the weight of a vehicle or pedestrian while protecting the wires from the weather.  | System Requirements |
| 8.  | Vehicle detector shall detect vehicles and motorcycles that are tailgating (when the front bumper of one vehicle is close to the back bumper and the two vehicles are in the same loop at the same time on one side of the roadway).  | System Requirements | 
| 9.  | Vehicle detector shall detect vehicles and motorcycles that are going in opposite directions on the roadway, but are within the detection range of the same loop at the exact same time.  | System Requirements |
| 10.  | Inductive loops shall be placed a minimum of 4 ft. apart from the edge of one loop to the edge of the other loop to avoid cross talk between the loops and possibly give false signals.  | System Requirements |

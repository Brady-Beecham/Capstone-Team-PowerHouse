# Ground-Based Sensor Subsystem

The purpose of the ground based sensor subsystem is to be able to detect a car/pickup truck's presence at a designated entrance/exit of a parking lot and determine whether the car/pickup truck (vehicle) is entering a parking lot or leaving a parking lot.  By using inductive loops instead of cameras for detecting vehicles at entrances/exits, parking lots that do not have the infrastructure necessary to support cameras are able to be monitored to determine if there is parking availability.

1. The system will need to detect vehicles that entering a parking lot or leaving a parking lot at a maximum speed of 20 mph.  With numerous parking lots on the campus of Tennessee Tech having designated entrances/exits requiring a vehicle to turn at a 90° angle, vehicles will not be able to have a speed that is higher than 20 mph.  If a vehicle enters a turn that is at a 90° angle at a speed higher than 20 mph, the vehicle will be at risk for overturning and damage not only to the vehicle, but also buildings that are near the turn.  By setting the maximum speed for a vehicle entering/exiting a lot at 20 mph, the inductive loops will be able to detect all vehicles passing through the entrance/exit of a parking lot.  Also, vehicles that use the monitored parking lots across campus consist of spots that are designed for cars and pickup trucks to park in as both faculty, staff, and students tend to use vehicles that are not larger than a standard pickup truck.  Vehicles used for commercial purposes, such as box trucks, flatbed trucks, etc., are highly unlikely to park in these spots as they tend to use more than one spot at a time.  For the prior statement, the focus of the sensor will be to detect cars and pickups only as these types of vehicles are the only vehicles with the capabilities to park in one parking spot in a lot on campus.
2. The vehicle detector system that will be used must be able to be either manually tuned or automatically tuned for frequency to cover the given range of inductance values or greater<sup>1</sup>.  When a vehicle passes over an inductive loop, the vehicle induces eddy currents in the loops.  The eddy currents then force the inductance of the loops to decrease, which leads to a change that is detected by the DSP-21 Vehicle Detector.  If inductance does not change, then a vehicle is not present within the detection range of the inductive loop.  According to the user manual of the Diablo DSP-21 Vehicle Detector, the range for the loop inductance (includes lead-in inductance) is 20 &mu;H to 1500 &mu;H<sup>6</sup>.  When a vehicle passes over the loop, the inductance will be within the 50 &mu;H to 1000 &mu;H range as the inductance will change due to the presence of a vehicle.
3. For the Diablo DSP-21 Vehicle Detector to be used on the market, it must follow FCC regulations regarding Intentional Radiators as the device intentionally outputs a frequency to use for detection of vehicles<sup>3</sup>.  By being in a frequency range of 10 kHz to 200 kHz, the device does not require a license to operate as it is part of the unlicensed Part 15 bands, mainly used by hobbyists in communication<sup>4</sup>.  With this device being within the permissible Part 15 bands, vehicles will not be affected by the frequency output from the loops that is generated by the Diablo DSP-21 Vehicle Detector.
4. For the system to correctly determine the direction of the vehicle, whether the vehicle is entering or leaving a lot, it will require two loops at each entrance/exit with a Diablo DSP-21 Vehicle Detector controlling both loops.  With the Diablo DSP-21 Vehicle Detector, each loop will be connected to a specific channel.  The detector will then be programmed using the DIP switch on the front of the detector for the intended purpose of the detector (specifics of the detector will be explained in the following sections along with the DIP switch and LEDs).  As an example, in order to monitor the Engineering Quad parking lot (parking lot between the four buildings for the College of Engineering), two sets consisting of two loops each and one detector each will be used to monitor the two designated entrances/exits of the parking lot.
5. For the inductive loops to be placed in the road, wire must be placed in the road and sidewalks (if there are any sidewalks at the specific entrance/exit) to connect the vehicle detector unit and any other necessary components to the loops.  To prevent the detector and other components from being accidentally destroyed by vehicles and/or pedestrians, extra wire will be necessary for the lead-in wire to allow the system to be placed in an area that is not affecting both vehicle traffic and pedestrian traffic.  As seen in Figure 4 below, the entrances/exits to the Engineering Quad parking lot behind Brown Hall have areas of grass next to the sidewalks that are within reasonable distance from the road and an ideal place to set the components.  Though the components will be at risk during the summer when the specified area will undergo landscaping projects, the components that are placed away from the road will be protected by safety boxes that will be discussed in the Housing subsystem.

# Analysis

## Power

The subsystem will be powered through the 11 Pin Harness connection found in Figure 1.  The recommended input voltage and current for the detector is 10.5 VDC to 35 VDC with 25 mA to 120 mA<sup>6</sup>.  Since the loops are connected directly to the vehicle detector unit, the loops will receive the necessary power through the detector.  The power through the loops will depend on the selections made using the on-board DIP switch with the provided table in both the user manual and the tables found under the Buildable Schematics section.  To ensure that the input power source is safely connected to the loops, size 14 AWG wire will be used to connect the loops to the detector.  Not only will the wire size be suitable for the amount of current in the wire<sup>5</sup>, but it will also provide extra protection for the wire as it is large enough that it is capable of tolerating a small amount of weight.  For the 11 Pin Harness Connector, the current flow is also small enough for 20 AWG wire to be used for the 11 Pin connection.  As the connections to the ESP32 Microcontroller GPIO pins are capable of handling a maximum of 20 mA of current, the input current to the GPIO pins will not exceed more than the rated maximum current.

## Vehicle Detection

The Diablo DSP-21 Vehicle Detector, found in Figure 1. Diablo DSP-21 Vehicle Detector with 11 Pin Harness, is displayed with both the front side and back side of the detector unit with the 11 Pin Harness Connection that connects the detector to the loops and other necessary equipment.  The 11 Pin Harness Connection is displayed upside down; however, the pins of the 11 Pin Harness are labeled to where each pin of the detector will be connected.  With two loops being connected to the detector, one for the loop closest to the road between Brown Hall and the Lab Science Commons building and the second loop closest to the Engineering Quad Parking lot between the buildings, they are connected to the pins on the harness that are directly connected to the detector.  The connections to the detector are 
is capable of detecting vehicles through an inductive loop by sending pulses through the loop.  The pulse output has a 300 millisecond (ms) period ± 10 ms with 150 ms ± 10 ms on and 150 ms ± 10 ms off before the next pulse is sent through the loops.  The response time for the detector is 150 ms ± 25 ms and can hold a vehicle for up to one hour in the loop and still detect the vehicle<sup>6</sup>.

## Inductive Loop Detection Range

For the loop to work correctly with the Diablo DSP-21 Vehicle Detector, the loop has to fit both the size requirements for the detector while also being a reasonable size to detect vehicles entering the Engineering Quad parking lot.  According to the Loop Size chart, using a 4 ft. by 6 ft. size inductive loop with 4 turns will provide an inductance value of 100 &mu;H with a detection height of 3.2 ft (approximately 38" height)<sup>7</sup>.  This size works well for the two entrances/exits of the Engineering Quad as it will be wide enough to detect vehicles that pass by it or pass over the loop in both lanes of traffic and long enough to be detected by the loop.  The detection height (detection range) is set to a height of 3.2 ft to ensure all vehicles are detected when entering through the inductive loops.  Though the ground clearance for many vehicles today is less than 2 ft, many vehicle owners (particularly truck owners) tend to increase the ground clearance of their vehicles for by installing lift kits for offroad purposes or other reasons.  To ensure all vehicles, including lifted trucks, are able to be detected when entering/exiting a lot, the detection height of the loop will be set to 3.2 ft using a 4 ft. by 6 ft. loop.  To ensure the detector would work function and count properly, both the loop inductance and lead-in inductance must be greater than or equal to a ratio of 2:1.  To calculate the loop inductance, the loop inductance formula must be used:

```math
L = (P/4) * (N + N^2);
```
where L = Loop Inductance in &mu;H, P = Perimeter of loop in ft., and N = Number of turns in the loop

For the lead-in loop inductance, the base value of 0.22 &mu;H/ft is used.  After calculating both the loop inductance value (100 &mu;H) and lead-in inductance value (5.5 &mu;H), the ratio is 18.2:1 which is greater than the ratio value of 2:1.  

## 11 Pin Harness

For the detector to work with the inductive loops, the detector will use an 11 Pin Harness to connect the output pins from the back side of the detector to the necessary connections.  This system will use a 15 VDC, 50 mA power supply with the positive connected to Pin 1 and negative to Pin 2.  Loop 1 (Channel 1) will be connected to Pins 7 and 8 while Loop 2 (Channel 2) will be connected to Pins 9 and 10 according to both the schematic drawing and the user manual of the Diablo DSP-21 Vehicle Detector.  To detect when a vehicle is present over one or both of the loops, the common pins of both Channels 1 and 2 will be connected, in parallel, to the 3V3 pin of the ESP32 MCU.  The normally open contact for Channel 1 will be connected to Pin VP of the ESP32 Microcontroller to detect a closed contact when Loop 1 detects a vehicle and the normally open contact for Channel 2 will be connected to Pin VN of the ESP32 Microcontroller to detect a closed contact when Loop 2 detects a vehicle.  To securely connect the harness connections to pins of the ESP32 Microcontroller, it will require specific connection ends to the wires to properly fit while also alerting the MCU of when a vehicle is present in either one or both of the loops.

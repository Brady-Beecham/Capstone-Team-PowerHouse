# Functions of the Subsystem

The ground based sensor subsystem is to sense vehicles passing above the sensor, allowing for the system to keep a count of the
number of cars that are in a specified parking lot on the campus of Tennessee Tech.  This system will be placed at parking lots
that have specified entrances/exits.  By using lots that have this constraint, it will allow the system to keep an accurate count
of the number of cars in a specific lot.

# Constraints
| No. | Constraints | Origin |
| --- | ----------- | ------ |
| 1.  | Subsystem shall detect vehicles entering and exiting a parking lot. | System Requirements |
| 2.  | Sensor shall function between 20 kHz and 100 kHz frequencies.       | System Requirements |

1. The system will need to detect vehicles that are in the detection area of the loop for determining whether a vehicle is entering a lot or exiting a lot.  For the parking lot in the Engineering Quad on the campus
   of Tennessee Tech University, there are two entrances/exits to access the parking lot.  This will require two loops at each entrance/exit with a Diablo DSP-15 Vehicle Detector controlling each loop.  One loop will be near the road that is in front of Brown Hall and the
   other loop will be at the exit of the parking lot for the entrance/exit.  These two loops will be

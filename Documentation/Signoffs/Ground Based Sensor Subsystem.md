# Functions of the Subsystem

The ground based sensor subsystem is to sense vehicles passing above the sensor, allowing for the system to keep a count of the
number of cars that are in a specified parking lot on the campus of Tennessee Tech.  This system will be placed at parking lots
that have specified entrances/exits.  By using lots that have this constraint, it will allow the system to keep an accurate count
of the number of cars in a specific lot.

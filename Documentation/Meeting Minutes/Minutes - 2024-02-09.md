# DISCUSSIONS
## Team Meeting
### 1) Brady Beecham - Charge Controller Subsystem and Solar Power Subsystem
  a) Charge Controller is almost complete and on track to possibly be done either by the deadline or a few days following the deadline.
### 2) Abdulrahman Alrudayan - Main Power Subsystem
  a) Almost complete with the Main Power Subsystem
### 3) Khalifah Altamimi - Power Controller Subsystems
  a) Start the fabrication portion of the Power Controller Subsystem
### 4) Kyle Plant - Data Interpretation/Transmission Subsystem
  a) Still working on the fabrication stage of the Data Subsystem
### 5) Michael Sisk - Loop Controller Subsystem
  a) Try adding a transformer circuit to the inductive loop portion to simulate inductance change in the Loop Controller.
  b) Also include mathematical calculations behind it if the simulation is not working fully. 
## NAVSEA Meeting
  1) Did not happen due to NAVSEA being unavailable for interviews following Spring 2024 Engineering Career Fair
# DECISIONS
  1) Look into other options, such as designing a simple Loop Controller, in the event the original Loop Controller is no longer suitable for the project.

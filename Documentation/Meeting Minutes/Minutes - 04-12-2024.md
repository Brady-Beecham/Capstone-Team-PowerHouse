# Discussions
  - Capstone Poster must be completed by 04/16/2024 at 4:30 pm.  This deadline is non-negotiable as it is the last week it can be printed before the Senior Design Expo.

# Decisions
  - Complete Poster by the end of 04/15/2024 so everyone can review and finalize any changes before submission.
  - Finalize Experimentation and turn Experimentation in.

# Decisions
1. Project is complete and the team station is organized with all equipment used such as batteries, MCUs, PCBs, etc. stored in the boxes on the team station table.
2. All personal equipment such as extension cords, jumper wires, breadboards, etc. is removed from the station and with their original owners.
3. All documentation (schematics, PCB files, images, reports, etc.) is placed in the correct location in the repository folders for the next team to reference and to know where the previous team ended the project.
4. Project was a success and received positive feedback from the department and other organizations such as SGA who want to learn more on how to possibly implement this system across campus after the completion of construction on campus.

# DISCUSSIONS
## Team Meeting
### 1) Brady Beecham - Charge Controller Subsystem and Solar Power Subsystem
a) Continue work on Charge Controller PCBs fabrication
### 2) Abdulrahman Alrudayan - Main Power Subsystem
a) Prepare experiments for the Main Power Experimentation
### 3) Khalifah Altamimi - Power Controller Subsystem
a) Prepare experiments for the Solar Power Experimentation
### 4) Kyle Plant - Data Interpretation/Transmission Subsystem
a) Test the Data Subsystem and verify the subsystem works accordingly. If not, resolve issues before Experimentation phase.
### 5) Michael Sisk - Loop Controller Subsystem
a) Help other teammates out where help is needed to continue progress on the project.
## NAVSEA Meeting
### 1) Brady Beecham - Charge Controller Subsystem and Solar Power Subsystem
a) Issues with MPPC PCB that is taking longer than expected to troubleshoot

b) Plan is to bypass MPPC

c) Battery Charger PCB is complete and is going through testing currently.

d) Developing a solution to test subsystem
### 2) Abdulrahman Alrudayan - Main Power Subsystem
a) Subsystem is working correctly and waiting for experimentation
### 3) Khalifah Altamimi - Power Controller Subsystem
a) Subsystem is working correctly and waiting for experimentation
### 4) Kyle Plant - Data Interpretation/Transmission Subsystem
a) LoRaWAN up and running

b) Pulse counter still experiencing issues due to timing and needing another library to monitor microseconds instead of milliseconds
### 5) Michael Sisk - Loop Controller Subsystem
a) Subsystem is working correctly and waiting for experimentation
### 6) Experimentation Phase
a) Have requirements and map out incremental evidence that will prove it works properly

b) Check each piece and do unit testing and build upon each unit, from beginning to end

c) Unit experimentation will work best as we can start and then build off good results

d) Power first, Loop Controller second, Data System third
# DECISIONS
1) Experimentation will happen on 03/24/2024 at 1 pm to
test current subsystems: Wall Power, Solar Power with
Batteries, Loop Controller, and Data System. Charge
Controller will not be available for experimentation yet
as it has experienced issues that is moving completion
time to a later date.

# DISCUSSIONS
  ## Roberts Meeting
    1) Brady Beecham - Charge Controller Subsystem
      a) With change in subsystem, creates extra unnecessary use on batteries due to usage not needed.
      b) Extra discharge is not needed as it will put more use on the batteries that will cause more wear on the battery.
      c) Hold off on mentioned design change in subsystem.
    2) Abdulrahman Alrudayan - Main Power Subsystem
      a) Specify constraints and what the subsystem needs then find the parts that help the subsystem achieve the constraints and goals of the subsystem.
      b) Not a good faith effort on design of subsystem
    3) Khalifah Altamimi - Solar Power and Power Controller Subsystems
      a) Current voltages/currents not 100% set due to changes in the Loop Controller Subsystem. Once set voltage and current values are determined for Loop Controller, values will be included and designs will be updated based on values given.
    4) Kyle Plant - Data Interpretation/Transmission Subsystem
      a) Shorter description in the sign-off file for Data Subsystem. Roberts completed quick review of pull request in GitHub.
# DECISIONS
  1) Highly likely that there will be no sign-offs during the Winter Break. Have as many of the subsystems complete by Dec. 1st.
